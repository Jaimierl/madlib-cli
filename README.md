# README Lab 3 Class Python 
## Madlibs

This program reads a Mad-Libs file, asks the user to put in parts of speech from the file, writes the users inputs back into the file, and creates a new file with the users inputs. There are also tests for the file writing process.

## Author: Jae Loney

## Setup
run with python madlib.py and test_madlib.py

## References: 
Worked with Brian, Marin, Brendon, and shared the code with the class. Also received TA assistance with parsing the information from the functions and putting this together with inputs. 

## Reflections:
The most interesting part of this lab is that in Python, you can save the different parts of a function return as comma separated variables in the dunder main gate. This made the main gate almost like its own fun problem to solve in terms of integrating the function returns with the inputs needed for the other functions. All of the functionality is working including saving the new string to a new file which is wildly exciting.
